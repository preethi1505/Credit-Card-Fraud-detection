# AI-Powered Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Overview

This project develops an intelligent system to automatically detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. By learning patterns from historical transaction data, the system scores new transactions for fraud risk. High-risk transactions trigger alerts for review or automated prevention, aiming to minimize financial losses and false positives. The system incorporates continuous monitoring and model updates to adapt to evolving fraud tactics and can be integrated for real-time detection.

## Objective

To design, develop, and evaluate an AI-powered system capable of accurately and efficiently detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time or near real-time. The system aims to significantly reduce financial losses due to fraud while minimizing the occurrence of false positives, thereby improving customer trust and operational efficiency. Continuous monitoring and adaptive model updates will ensure sustained high performance against evolving fraud patterns.
